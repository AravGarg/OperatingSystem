# Learning to write an Operating System

Also known as [system programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming).  
Preparatory for future contributions to the [Linux kernel](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linux-foundation/who-writes-linux-2015), [forks](https://coreos.com/), drivers,
or any kind of [[micro]controller](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) hardware.  
As well as decompiling, hacking, and [modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) [malware](https://zeltser.com/build-malware-analysis-toolkit/) or [backdoor](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/27/stamos_slams_rsa_conference/) analysis.  
Or just understanding [how computers work](http://www.virtual-science.co.uk/tomsimulator.html).  
  
In this repository there are several flavors based on various tutorials.

- **[v1](v1)**  
  inspired by following the tutorial at [OSDev.org](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)

- **[v2](v2)**  
  an attempt to minimize [v1](v1)
  following the work of [Mike Saunders](https://github.com/mig-hub/mikeOS).

- **[v3](v3)**
